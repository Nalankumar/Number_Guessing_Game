# Number_Guessing_Game

   The Number Guessing Game project built with Java Swing is an interactive game where the computer generates a random number, and the user attempts to guess it within a limited number of attempts, typically three lives. The user interface is created using Java Swing components, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

   Upon starting the game, the computer generates a random number within a predefined range, which serves as the target number for the user to guess. The user interface displays an input field where the user can enter their guess and a button to submit their guess.

   After submitting a guess, the program evaluates the user's input and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. If the guess is incorrect, the user loses one life, and the remaining lives are displayed on the interface. If the user runs out of lives without correctly guessing the number, the game ends, and the user is prompted to play again.

   If the user successfully guesses the number within the allotted number of lives, they win the game, and their score is increased. The user interface displays a congratulatory message along with their score, encouraging them to continue playing to improve their score.

   The game also features functionality to keep track of the user's highest score across multiple sessions, providing an added incentive for players to improve their performance.

   Overall, the Number Guessing Game project built with Java Swing offers an engaging and entertaining experience for players of all ages, challenging them to use their logical reasoning and deduction skills to guess the correct number while enjoying a visually appealing user interface.
